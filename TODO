TODO List:

- Add user data into media_descriptor to reference internal VLC object -- fix not committed to SVN.

- Fix stream.c to recognize VLC_ENOOBJECT
- Easy way to tell the length of the movie without having to instiate the demuxer.  Maybe cached info?
- Hook into "length" variable for media streams vs. using intf-change as a hook.
- Figure out a better way to raise error messages versus quit_on_exception
- Have VLCMedia search for playable files when directories are referenced.
- Only fetch meta data that has been requested.  Just don't fetch it, just because.
- md callback to notify VLCMedia that it is about to be destroyed.
- add media_list_player
